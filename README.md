# Rock-Racer

**Version 1.0.0**

This is a creative ASCII art python program. The idea of this program is to complete a variety of mathmatical questions as fast as you can ideally without the help of a calculator. Every time you answer a question right the ASCII art will update to reflect the rock moving closer to the finish line. If you get a question wrong you will be prompted to try again and you will recieve one point for every submission. The goal is to have the least amount of points at the end, the lowest score possible would be 6 which would indicate you missed zero questions. Once the rock reaches the finish line the program will terminate.
